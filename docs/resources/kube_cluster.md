# lattice_kube_cluster

Provisions a LatticeKube cluster — a k3s control plane and workers running as Firecracker microVMs on LatticeVE. Creation is asynchronous — the resource polls until the cluster reaches `ready` or `failed` status (30-minute timeout).

Worker count and control-plane count can be scaled in place. Control-plane counts must remain `1`, `3`, or `5`, and only scale-out is supported. Kubernetes upgrades are performed by changing `rootfs_id` to a newer, upgrade-compatible `lattice_k3s_rootfs_image`; the provider waits for the controller's rolling control-plane and worker upgrade to finish.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "lattice_k3s_kernel" "kube" {
  arch = "amd64"
  # version = "6.1.175" # optional production pin
}

resource "lattice_k3s_rootfs_image" "release" {
  arch    = "amd64"
  version = "v1.36.2+k3s1-r23"

  lifecycle {
    create_before_destroy = true
  }
}

resource "lattice_public_ip_pool" "kube" {
  name      = "kube-pool"
  interface = "br0"
  cidr      = "10.0.7.128/28"
}

resource "lattice_kube_cluster" "prod" {
  name      = "prod"
  kernel_id = lattice_k3s_kernel.kube.id
  rootfs_id = lattice_k3s_rootfs_image.release.id
  pool_id   = lattice_public_ip_pool.kube.id
  cni       = "flannel"
  lb_mode   = "ccm"

  cp_count     = 3
  cp_vcpus     = 4
  cp_memory_mb = 8192
  cp_disk_gb   = 50

  worker_count     = 3
  worker_vcpus     = 8
  worker_memory_mb = 16384
  worker_disk_gb   = 100
}

output "kubeconfig" {
  value     = lattice_kube_cluster.prod.kubeconfig
  sensitive = true
}
```

The pool CIDR must be reserved inside the selected external bridge's connected IPv4 subnet and excluded from upstream DHCP. The cluster allocates and manages its own API endpoint address from `pool_id`; do not create a separate `lattice_public_ip` for it.

## Scale-out Example

```hcl
resource "lattice_kube_cluster" "prod" {
  # ... other arguments unchanged ...
  worker_count = 5  # was 3 — adding 2 workers
}
```

Control-plane scale-out uses the same resource:

```hcl
resource "lattice_kube_cluster" "prod" {
  # ... other arguments unchanged ...
  cp_count = 3 # supported transitions: 1 -> 3 -> 5
}
```

## Upgrade Example

Change the pinned rootfs image to the next supported Kubernetes patch or minor release and apply:

```hcl
resource "lattice_k3s_rootfs_image" "release" {
  arch    = "amd64"
  version = "v1.36.2+k3s1-r23"

  lifecycle {
    create_before_destroy = true
  }
}

resource "lattice_kube_cluster" "prod" {
  # ...
  rootfs_id = lattice_k3s_rootfs_image.release.id
}
```

LatticeVE validates the upgrade path, snapshots etcd, upgrades HA control planes one at a time with an etcd/API health check between nodes, then drains, upgrades, and uncordons workers. Terraform waits for `ready`; `failed` and `upgrade_blocked` are returned as apply errors while preserving the cluster for operator recovery.

## Argument Reference

- `name` (Required, Forces new resource) — Cluster name.
- `runtime` (Optional, Computed, Forces new resource) — VM backend for cluster nodes. Only `firecracker` is supported.
- `kernel_id` (Optional, Computed, Forces new resource) — Kubernetes-compatible Firecracker kernel UUID, normally from `lattice_k3s_kernel`.
- `rootfs_id` (Optional, Computed) — Rootfs image UUID from `lattice_rootfs_image` or `lattice_k3s_rootfs_image`. Changing it invokes the safe in-place upgrade/revision workflow.
- `storage` (Optional, Computed, Forces new resource) — Named storage backend for cluster VM disks. Empty uses the default backend.
- `k8s_version` (Optional, Computed) — Kubernetes version, e.g. `v1.32.0`. Inferred from the rootfs image's name/description when omitted.
- `cni` (Optional, Computed, Forces new resource) — CNI plugin: `flannel`, `cilium`, or `none`.
- `lb_mode` (Optional, Computed, Forces new resource) — Load-balancer mode: `ccm`, `metallb`, or `cilium`.
- `pool_id` (Optional, Forces new resource) — Public IP pool ID for the control-plane floating IP.
- `cp_count` (Optional, Computed) — Control-plane node count. Must be 1, 3, or 5. Scale-out is in place; scale-down is rejected.
- `worker_count` (Optional, Computed) — Worker node count. **Updatable** — increase to scale out, decrease to scale in.
- `cp_vcpus` (Optional, Computed, Forces new resource) — vCPUs per control-plane node.
- `cp_memory_mb` (Optional, Computed, Forces new resource) — Memory per control-plane node in MiB.
- `cp_disk_gb` (Optional, Computed, Forces new resource) — Boot disk per control-plane node in GiB.
- `worker_vcpus` (Optional, Computed, Forces new resource) — vCPUs per worker node.
- `worker_memory_mb` (Optional, Computed, Forces new resource) — Memory per worker node in MiB.
- `worker_disk_gb` (Optional, Computed, Forces new resource) — Boot disk per worker node in GiB.

## Attribute Reference

- `id` — Cluster UUID.
- `kernel_version` — Linux kernel version used by cluster nodes.
- `status` — Cluster lifecycle: `provisioning`, `ready`, `failed`, `deleting`.
- `endpoint` — Kubernetes API server URL.
- `public_ip` — Allocated public IP for the control plane.
- `vpc_id` — VPC UUID created for this cluster.
- `vpc_cidr` — CIDR assigned to the cluster VPC.
- `kubeconfig` (Sensitive) — kubeconfig YAML for `kubectl` access.
- `nodes` — Cluster nodes with `id`, `vm_id`, `name`, `role`, `ip`, `status`, live `kubelet_version`, and any node-specific `upgrade_error`.
